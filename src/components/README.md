# Components

This directory contains reusable UI components for SmartOPD.

## Structure
- Components should be modular and reusable across different pages
- Each component should have a clear, single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## Naming Convention
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `NavBar.tsx`)
- Keep components self-contained

## Future Components
- Button
- NavBar
- Card
- Input
- Modal
- etc.
